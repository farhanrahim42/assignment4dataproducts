## Prerequisite of presentation

Your presentation must satisfy the following

1.  It must be done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter
2.  It must be 5 pages
3.  It must be hosted on github or Rpubs
4.  It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document

## Your Shiny Application

- Was there enough documentation on the shiny site for a user to get started using the application?
- Did the application run as described in the documentation?
- Was there some form of widget input (slider, textbox, radio buttons, checkbox, ...) in either ui.R or a custom web page?
- Did server.R perform some calculations on the input in server.R?
- Was the server calculation displayed in the html page?
- Was the app substantively different than the very simple applications built in the class? 

Note, it's OK if the app is simple and based on the one presented in class. I just don't want it to be basically a carbon copy of the examples we covered. For example, if someone simply changed the variable names, then this would not count. However, a prediction algorithm that had a similar layout would be fine.
Here's your opportunity to give the app +1 for being well done, or neat, or even just a solid effort.

## coding explain

Rely on the 'WorldPhones' dataset in the datasets
package (which generally comes preloaded).
library(datasets)

Define a server for the Shiny app
function(input, output) {
  
  # Fill in the spot we created for a plot
  output$computerPlot <- renderPlot({
    
    # Render a barplot
    barplot(WorldComputer[,input$region]*1000, 
            main=input$region,
            ylab="Number of Computers",
            xlab="Year")
  })
}

Since the value in data in Kilo (means x 1000), we need to multiply with 1000.
